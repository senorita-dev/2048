# 2048

2048 clone made from scratch for fun.

I learnt how to use React useReducers & maintain a pure state.
The grid rendering layout, CSS animations, and an efficient move algorithm were tricky to figure out at first!

This project was built using Typescript and React, and deployed manually to a DigitalOcean server hosting my website.
